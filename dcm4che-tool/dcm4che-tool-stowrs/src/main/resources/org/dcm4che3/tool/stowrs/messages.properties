description=\n\
For DICOM files : ability to send multiple dicom files to STOW-RS receiver at a time. \
For metadata+bulkdata : Reads metadata from specified metadata file \
or parameters and send them to a STOW-RS receiver. Currently tool supports sending of only one bulkdata file at a time to STOW-RS receiver.\
Attributes for bulkdata can be specified using -m <metadata> or -f <file>
Options:
example=-\n\
Example: stowrs -m PatientName=John^Doe -u http://localhost/stow/studies[/{StudyInstanceUID}] img.jpeg \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver with the attribute given and img.jpeg bulkData.
Example: stowrs -u http://localhost/stow/studies[/{StudyInstanceUID}] img.dcm \n\
=> Send stow request to stowRS Receiver with the given dicom file.
metadata=specify metadata attributes. attr can be specified by keyword or tag value \
(in hex), e.g. PatientName or 00100010. Attributes in nested Datasets can be \
specified by including the keyword/tag value of the sequence attribute, \
e.g. 00400275/00400009 for Scheduled Procedure Step ID in the Request.
url=specify the request URL.
file=specify the file containing the metadata in XML format.
type=specify the value for Content-type header : xml or json. \
The value of Content-type will then be sent in request header as application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
If this flag is absent, for bulkdata type of objects application/dicom+xml will be used by default. \
Note that for DICOM objects, tool will always send Content-type as application/dicom.
accept=Specify the value for Accept header : xml or json. \
The value of Accept header will then be sent in request header as application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
Note that for DICOM objects application/dicom+xml will always be used by default. \
If this flag is absent, for bulkdata type of objects the value specified in -t option will be used to determine application/dicom+xml or application/dicom+json. \
If -t option is absent as well then application/dicom+xml will be used by default. 
pixel-header=Specify value as true if metadata information is to be extracted from header of pixel data for jpegs and mpegs. \
If absent pixel header will not be read; user has to then ensure that pixel data related attributes should be present either in \
metadata file or from command line to ensure seeing the images/videos correctly.
no-appn=Specify value as true if application segments APPn are to be excluded from JPEG stream; encapsulate JPEG stream verbatim by default.
